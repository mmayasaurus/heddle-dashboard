# CI & review on this repo

Everything runs on GitHub-hosted runners (the repo is public, so minutes are free) and is defined
in `.github/`. Ported from the Spinventory fleet's CI (deterministic tier + gate) and simplified for
a public repo; the reviewer-fleet enablement items that need Maya's account (branch ruleset, app
installs) are tracked in Linear **HED-13**.

## What runs

| Workflow | Trigger | Jobs | Posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gate.yml` | push `main`, **PRs to any base** (stacked PRs included) incl. base retargets + title/body edits, manual | **`gate`** aggregates **`web`** (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → `pnpm build` → `pnpm test`), **`rust`** (`cargo check --locked`, default `gui` and `--no-default-features`) and **`rust-test`** (`cargo test --locked`) — each guarded to commit-events — and records a `gate-verdict` marker; a title/body edit makes `gate` **echo** that marker instead of rebuilding (no cold rust rebuild). **`lint`** (`pnpm lint`) stays outside the aggregator | `gate` is the **required** merge check (job name is the ruleset's context string — don't rename); edit-safe via the verdict echo (HED-142 — see below); `lint` is honest-red until HED-14 |
| `deterministic-review.yml` | PRs (incl. drafts for gitleaks; base-branch retargets), push `main` | **semgrep** (`p/typescript` + `p/react` + `p/rust`, diff-aware vs the PR base, full on `main`, SARIF → code scanning) · **gitleaks** (official CLI over exactly `base.sha..head.sha`). gitleaks' shell lives in `.github/scripts/gitleaks-range-scan.sh` (HED-113) so the fixture matrix can exercise it directly | semgrep report-only · gitleaks red on a hit (not required) |
| `actions-hygiene.yml` | PRs / `main` pushes touching `.github/**` | **actionlint** · **zizmor** (SARIF → code scanning) | actionlint red on findings · zizmor report (same-repo) / red (forks) |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | weekly | grouped bumps of the hash-pinned actions, 7-day cooldown | — |
| `.deepsource.toml` | (DeepSource app, once installed — HED-13) | JS/TS (React) + Rust + shell + secrets analyzers, repo-accurate config | merged *before* the app so it doesn't invent work |

Findings surface as **code-scanning alerts** ("Code scanning results / <tool>" checks + the Security
tab), job summaries, and the job log — plus whatever the AI reviewer apps post. The `.deepsource.toml`
exists because an unconfigured DeepSource opened ~118 non-defect threads on one Spinventory PR.

The Rust jobs share `.github/actions/tauri-rust-setup` (Tauri's documented apt deps on `ubuntu-22.04`,
pnpm/Node, the frontend build that `tauri-build` needs for `../dist`, `rustup` stable, cargo cache).

## Rules baked into the workflows (don't undo them casually)

- **A green scanner check is not a scan — assert the scanned volume.** The gitleaks step computes
  `git rev-list --count --no-merges base..head` itself, runs gitleaks with `--no-color` so its log is
  exactly zerolog's `<time> <LEVEL> <msg>`, and reds the job when any line's LEVEL is `ERR`/`FTL`
  or the `INF N commits scanned` count is below the expected number (a finding whose path merely
  contains "ERR" cannot trip it). Origin: in a `container:` job the
  workspace is owned by the runner uid and `actions/checkout` writes its `safe.directory` entry to a
  temporary HOME, so gitleaks' internal `git log` failed with "dubious ownership" — and gitleaks
  still exited 0 with "0 commits scanned … no leaks found". Two rounds of a PR were green with an
  empty scan before a human read the log. Every container-job script therefore starts with
  `git config --global --add safe.directory "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"`, and any scanner added later must
  ship with a volume assertion from day one (semgrep/zizmor: HED-70).
- **Suppressions are PR-controlled, so the scan never trusts the PR's copy.** gitleaks scans with
  the *base branch's* `.gitleaks.toml`/`.gitleaksignore` (or a default-rules stub), ignores inline
  `gitleaks:allow`, and moves the PR's working-tree copies aside (gitleaks merges
  `<source>/.gitleaksignore` unconditionally). semgrep swaps every `.semgrepignore` for the base
  branch's copy via a local commit (`--baseline-commit` refuses a dirty tree) and passes
  `--disable-nosem`. Consequence: a new suppression must land on `main` in its own reviewed PR
  before another PR can benefit from it.
- **Container jobs are POSIX `sh`.** Inside `container:` the runner defaults to `sh -e`, not bash —
  a bash array in the first run of the semgrep step failed with `syntax error: unexpected "("`.
- **Everything is pinned.** Actions by full SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment (zizmor's default
  `unpinned-uses` policy; Dependabot bumps them). Container images and `docker://` uses are
  tag+digest pinned and are **manual bumps** — Dependabot does not track them (each carries a
  `MANUAL BUMP` note). Runners are pinned to an Ubuntu series, never `-latest`.
- **Least privilege.** Workflow-level `permissions: {}`, per-job grants with a comment on each,
  `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout, no PR-controlled string expanded into a `run:`.
- **Fork PRs get scanned too**; only the SARIF-upload steps (write token) are same-repo-guarded.
- `pull_request: edited` in **`deterministic-review.yml`** is handled *only* for base-branch retargets
  (the baseline/range moves); title/body edits are skipped by the job guards and get their own
  concurrency group so they never cancel an in-flight scan. The required **`gate`** check handles edits
  differently — it *echoes* the last real verdict rather than skipping (skipping would mask a red); see
  the verdict echo below.

## GitHub required-status-check semantics — observed (HED-142)

GitHub resolves a required status check from the newest check-run of the required name **in the newest
check-suite** on the head commit — suite-creation order, not run-completion order (rows 1, 6, 7). Rows
1–6 are observed `mergeable_state` from a real PR in the sandbox `mmayasaurus/heddle-gate-sandbox` (a
throwaway repo whose ruleset required exactly one check named `gate`, `strict:false`); row 7 is a live
observation from dashboard#45 — not doc-inference. Legend: `blocked` = a required check is unsatisfied
(cannot merge), `unstable` = mergeable but a non-required check is failing/pending, `clean` =
mergeable and all green.

| # | Scenario | Latest `gate` check-runs (oldest→newest) | `mergeable_state` | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | baseline; commit run then bot-edit churn | success, cancelled, success, success | `unstable` | Latest `gate` success ⇒ mergeable. A mid-sequence CANCELLED run did not stick because a later same-SHA success superseded it (a later same-SHA **suite** supersedes for resolution — see row 7). Unstable only because non-required bot checks were pending. |
| 2 | gate job `if:false` on every run | skipped, skipped, skipped | `unstable` | A required check that is only ever `skipped` is treated as satisfied ⇒ skip does not block. |
| 3 | red commit, then a later `skipped` run (masking test) | failure, failure, cancelled, failure, skipped | `clean` | A `skipped` run SUPERSEDES prior failures ⇒ skip MASKS a real red. Unsafe. |
| 4 | dynamic job name — `gate` on commit, `gate-edit` on a body edit | `gate`=success, then `gate-edit`=success (×N) | `blocked` | The latest check-suite produced `gate-edit`, not `gate`, so the required `gate` context reads unsatisfied ⇒ BLOCKED, even though an earlier suite delivered `gate` green. |
| 5 | verdict-echo — green commit, then a title/body edit storm | `gate`=success (commit), then `gate`=success (×N echo runs) | `clean` | Every edit run publishes the STATIC `gate` context (never `gate-edit`), so the latest suite always satisfies the requirement ⇒ stays mergeable through edits. Solves row 4. |
| 6 | verdict-echo anti-mask — red commit, then an edit that REMOVES the failing marker from the title | `gate`=failure (commit) + a `gate-verdict`=failure marker, then `gate`=failure (×N echo, incl. after the title no longer signals failure) | `blocked` | The echo re-emits the SHA-bound `gate-verdict` rather than recomputing from the current title, so a red STAYS red across edits ⇒ does NOT mask (the exact hole row 3's skip left open). |
| 7 | verdict-echo marker race on a SLOW build — commit run still building when bot edits fire (dashboard#45, live) | commit `gate`=success in the OLDEST suite; edit-echoes that gave up waiting for the marker = failure in NEWER suites | `blocked` | GitHub reads the required context from the newest SUITE, so the newer fail-closed echoes blocked the PR even though the commit success completed later — and `gh pr checks`, which uses the newest RUN, showed `pass` (the divergence is the tell; `mergeable_state` is the authority). **Fixed** by making the echo WAIT for the marker (stay pending) instead of failing closed at a fixed timeout, so it never lands a premature red in a newer suite. Live-only: the sandbox can't show it — instant builds keep suite-order and run-order aligned. |

These force three constraints on any edit-safe gate: every run must publish the static required context
`gate` [row 4 — omitting it blocks]; an edit run must never publish a passing or `skipped` `gate` that
misrepresents a real red [row 3 — skip masks]; and an edit run's `gate` must not be turned red by
cancellation (a cancelled required check reds the PR until a later suite supersedes — dashboard#41). The
verdict echo below is the shape that satisfies all three, validated by rows 5–6, with the slow-build
timing corner (row 7) fixed by the pending-wait.

*Sandbox vs live:* the sandbox validates the **semantics** (which conclusion supersedes which); only a
live PR validates the **timing** — suite-creation order versus run-completion order — because the
sandbox's instant builds keep the two aligned. Row 7 is a live-only finding.

## The gate survives PR edits: the verdict echo (HED-142)

Reviewer bots edit PR bodies constantly, and each edit fires a `pull_request: edited` check-suite. The
matrix above rules out the two shortcuts — skipping an edit run **masks** a red (row 3); renaming the
edit run's job **blocks** the PR because the latest suite no longer carries `gate` (row 4). So every
run, commit or edit, must publish a `gate` conclusion equal to the real verdict for the head commit.
`gate.yml` does that with a **verdict echo**:

- **Commit / retarget / push** runs do the real work — the leaf jobs (`build` in core; `web` + `rust` +
  `rust-test` in the dashboard), each guarded to commit-events with an `if:`. The `gate` job takes their
  aggregate conclusion, records it as a **non-required `gate-verdict` marker check-run on the head SHA**,
  and exits with it. `gate` is the real verdict.
- **Title/body-edit** runs skip the leaf jobs (no cold rebuild) and the `gate` job **echoes**: it reads
  the head SHA's latest `gate-verdict` and exits with exactly that conclusion. An edit can only *repeat*
  the verdict the commit already earned — green stays green, red stays red — so it never masks (row 6)
  and always publishes the static `gate` context (row 5).

Two mechanisms keep it honest:

- **Discriminator `github.event.changes.base.ref.from`** — populated on a base **retarget** (which must
  re-run the real gate against the new base), empty/absent on a title/body edit (which echoes). GitHub
  coerces the absent value so `!= ''` is *false* for a plain edit; verified in the sandbox, and both
  `gate.yml`s derive `IS_EDIT` from the same expression.
- **Two concurrency slots.** Commit-driven events share a `run` slot with `cancel-in-progress: true` (a
  newer commit supersedes the stale run). Title/body edits use an `edit` slot with
  `cancel-in-progress: false` — echoes are ~5 s and are never cancelled, so a cancelled edit run can
  never red the required context (the failure measured on dashboard#41).

The `gate-verdict` marker is deliberately **not** required — requiring it would recreate the row-4 block
(it exists only on commit runs). Do not add it to the ruleset.

Residuals, by design:

- **Marker race.** An edit that fires before the commit run has published its marker finds none. The
  echo does **not** fail closed early — a premature red would land in a check-suite *newer* than the
  commit run's own gate, and since GitHub resolves the required check from the newest suite, it would
  block the PR until another edit superseded it (exactly what an earlier fixed-150 s version did to
  dashboard#45 — matrix row 7). Instead the echo stays **pending**, polling for the marker while a
  commit-path job for the SHA is still in flight (up to a ~20 min ceiling) and self-describing that
  pending state in its job summary. A pending required check correctly blocks merge *while the build
  runs*, then resolves to the real verdict once the commit run publishes. It fails closed only if the
  marker never appears (commit run cancelled or never ran), with a self-describing remedy (re-run
  `gate`, or push a commit).
- **Reopen.** `reopened` is a commit-path event, so it re-runs the real gate and refreshes the marker
  for the (unchanged) head SHA; verdicts are SHA-bound, so reopen carries no stale-verdict hazard —
  which is also why close/reopen reliably forces a fresh verdict after a runner-side outage.
- **Fork PRs.** On a fork-head PR `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read-only regardless of `permissions:`, so the
  marker POST 403s. The commit path still reports the real verdict (the POST is best-effort and only
  warns); only later *edit* runs on a fork degrade — and they **fail closed, never mask**. The fleet
  uses same-repo branches, where the marker always publishes.

## The review sweep (before anything is called clean)

Full procedure with the exact commands: [REVIEW-SWEEP.md](REVIEW-SWEEP.md). In short: a PR is clean only after **every channel** — issue comments, review bodies, inline threads,
code-scanning alerts, and the checks tab — has been read against the **latest** commit and every
item fixed or answered with rationale (dispute bots with evidence, never rubber-stamp). Some
reviewers need a manual trigger (CodeRabbit on repos with <10 stars: comment `@coderabbitai
review`). The commands for every channel are in [REVIEW-SWEEP.md](REVIEW-SWEEP.md); the maintainers'
fleet automates the same sweep with a script kept outside this repo. Two clean sweeps ≥15 minutes
apart against the SAME commit are the bar (late-landing bots), and merges are merge commits — never squash,
never force.

### Standing rules (Maya, 2026-08-15 — apply to everyone, orchestrator included)

- **No direct commits to `main`.** Every change goes on a branch → PR → the full review sweep → merge.
- **As many revision rounds as it takes.** Every reviewer bot on both repos is there on purpose; every
  comment / review body / inline thread is addressed (fix, or reply+resolve with evidence) before merge.
  "Green" is not "clean" — clean means zero unaddressed items against HEAD after the double sweep.
- **Behavioral tests, not toggle tests.** A test that proves a switch flips is NOT a test that proves
  the switch DOES the thing ("does turning it on actually turn the function on, not just the toggle").
  Every PR's tests must assert the observable effect: state / persisted result / downstream behavior,
  not the UI or flag alone. Reviewers grade tests on this bar; superficial tests are a review finding to fix.
- **Two lessons already paid for:** a PR that has a merge conflict gets NO `pull_request` workflow runs
  (GitHub skips them silently) — check `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable` before assuming CI is slow; and
  a green scanner check is not proof a scan happened — assert the scanned volume (see the rules above).

## Deliberately NOT here

Spinventory's Deep Reviewers I–V, its Gemini review workflow and PR-Agent are OpenRouter/Ollama-keyed
and are **not** ported (Maya, 2026-08-15: no OpenRouter expansion; the public repos already get
15+ free reviewers). Recorded in HED-13 — please don't re-propose.
