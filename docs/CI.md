# CI & review on this repo

Everything runs on GitHub-hosted runners (the repo is public, so minutes are free) and is defined
in `.github/`. Ported from the Spinventory fleet's CI (deterministic tier + gate) and simplified for
a public repo; the reviewer-fleet enablement items that need Maya's account (branch ruleset, app
installs) are tracked in Linear **HED-13**.

## What runs

| Workflow | Trigger | Jobs | Posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gate.yml` | push `main`, **PRs to any base** (stacked PRs included) incl. base retargets, manual | **`gate`** = aggregator over **`web`** (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → `pnpm build` → `pnpm test`), **`rust`** (`cargo check --locked`, default `gui` and `--no-default-features`) and **`rust-test`** (`cargo test --locked`); plus **`lint`** (`pnpm lint`) outside the aggregator | `gate` is the **required** merge check (job name is the ruleset's context string — don't rename); `lint` is honest-red until HED-14 |
| `deterministic-review.yml` | PRs (incl. drafts for gitleaks; base-branch retargets), push `main` | **semgrep** (`p/typescript` + `p/react` + `p/rust`, diff-aware vs the PR base, full on `main`, SARIF → code scanning) · **gitleaks** (official CLI over exactly `base.sha..head.sha`) | semgrep report-only · gitleaks red on a hit (not required) |
| `actions-hygiene.yml` | PRs / `main` pushes touching `.github/**` | **actionlint** · **zizmor** (SARIF → code scanning) | actionlint red on findings · zizmor report (same-repo) / red (forks) |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | weekly | grouped bumps of the hash-pinned actions, 7-day cooldown | — |
| `.deepsource.toml` | (DeepSource app, once installed — HED-13) | JS/TS (React) + Rust + shell + secrets analyzers, repo-accurate config | merged *before* the app so it doesn't invent work |

Findings surface as **code-scanning alerts** ("Code scanning results / <tool>" checks + the Security
tab), job summaries, and the job log — plus whatever the AI reviewer apps post. The `.deepsource.toml`
exists because an unconfigured DeepSource opened ~118 non-defect threads on one Spinventory PR.

The Rust jobs share `.github/actions/tauri-rust-setup` (Tauri's documented apt deps on `ubuntu-22.04`,
pnpm/Node, the frontend build that `tauri-build` needs for `../dist`, `rustup` stable, cargo cache).

## Rules baked into the workflows (don't undo them casually)

- **A green scanner check is not a scan — assert the scanned volume.** The gitleaks step computes
  `git rev-list --count --no-merges base..head` itself, runs gitleaks with `--no-color` so its log is
  exactly zerolog's `<time> <LEVEL> <msg>`, and reds the job when any line's LEVEL is `ERR`/`FTL`
  or the `INF N commits scanned` count is below the expected number (a finding whose path merely
  contains "ERR" cannot trip it). Origin: in a `container:` job the
  workspace is owned by the runner uid and `actions/checkout` writes its `safe.directory` entry to a
  temporary HOME, so gitleaks' internal `git log` failed with "dubious ownership" — and gitleaks
  still exited 0 with "0 commits scanned … no leaks found". Two rounds of a PR were green with an
  empty scan before a human read the log. Every container-job script therefore starts with
  `git config --global --add safe.directory "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"`, and any scanner added later must
  ship with a volume assertion from day one (semgrep/zizmor: HED-70).
- **Suppressions are PR-controlled, so the scan never trusts the PR's copy.** gitleaks scans with
  the *base branch's* `.gitleaks.toml`/`.gitleaksignore` (or a default-rules stub), ignores inline
  `gitleaks:allow`, and moves the PR's working-tree copies aside (gitleaks merges
  `<source>/.gitleaksignore` unconditionally). semgrep swaps every `.semgrepignore` for the base
  branch's copy via a local commit (`--baseline-commit` refuses a dirty tree) and passes
  `--disable-nosem`. Consequence: a new suppression must land on `main` in its own reviewed PR
  before another PR can benefit from it.
- **Container jobs are POSIX `sh`.** Inside `container:` the runner defaults to `sh -e`, not bash —
  a bash array in the first run of the semgrep step failed with `syntax error: unexpected "("`.
- **Everything is pinned.** Actions by full SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment (zizmor's default
  `unpinned-uses` policy; Dependabot bumps them). Container images and `docker://` uses are
  tag+digest pinned and are **manual bumps** — Dependabot does not track them (each carries a
  `MANUAL BUMP` note). Runners are pinned to an Ubuntu series, never `-latest`.
- **Least privilege.** Workflow-level `permissions: {}`, per-job grants with a comment on each,
  `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout, no PR-controlled string expanded into a `run:`.
- **Fork PRs get scanned too**; only the SARIF-upload steps (write token) are same-repo-guarded.
- `pull_request: edited` is handled *only* for base-branch retargets (the baseline/range moves);
  title/body edits are skipped by the job guards and get their own concurrency group so they never
  cancel an in-flight scan.

## The review sweep (before anything is called clean)

Full procedure with the exact commands: [REVIEW-SWEEP.md](REVIEW-SWEEP.md). In short: a PR is clean only after **every channel** — issue comments, review bodies, inline threads,
code-scanning alerts, and the checks tab — has been read against the **latest** commit and every
item fixed or answered with rationale (dispute bots with evidence, never rubber-stamp). Some
reviewers need a manual trigger (CodeRabbit on repos with <10 stars: comment `@coderabbitai
review`). The commands for every channel are in [REVIEW-SWEEP.md](REVIEW-SWEEP.md); the maintainers'
fleet automates the same sweep with a script kept outside this repo. Two clean sweeps ≥15 minutes
apart against the SAME commit are the bar (late-landing bots), and merges are merge commits — never squash,
never force.

### Standing rules (Maya, 2026-08-15 — apply to everyone, orchestrator included)

- **No direct commits to `main`.** Every change goes on a branch → PR → the full review sweep → merge.
- **As many revision rounds as it takes.** Every reviewer bot on both repos is there on purpose; every
  comment / review body / inline thread is addressed (fix, or reply+resolve with evidence) before merge.
  "Green" is not "clean" — clean means zero unaddressed items against HEAD after the double sweep.
- **Behavioral tests, not toggle tests.** A test that proves a switch flips is NOT a test that proves
  the switch DOES the thing ("does turning it on actually turn the function on, not just the toggle").
  Every PR's tests must assert the observable effect: state / persisted result / downstream behavior,
  not the UI or flag alone. Reviewers grade tests on this bar; superficial tests are a review finding to fix.
- **Two lessons already paid for:** a PR that has a merge conflict gets NO `pull_request` workflow runs
  (GitHub skips them silently) — check `gh pr view <n> --json mergeable` before assuming CI is slow; and
  a green scanner check is not proof a scan happened — assert the scanned volume (see the rules above).

## Deliberately NOT here

Spinventory's Deep Reviewers I–V, its Gemini review workflow and PR-Agent are OpenRouter/Ollama-keyed
and are **not** ported (Maya, 2026-08-15: no OpenRouter expansion; the public repos already get
15+ free reviewers). Recorded in HED-13 — please don't re-propose.
