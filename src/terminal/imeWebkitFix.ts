//! Workaround for delayed IME punctuation in WebKit, including macOS WKWebView.
//!
//! ## Background
//! macOS WebKit has long-standing IME event bugs (WebKit Bugzilla #164324 / #165004). Full-width punctuation
//! committed **directly without candidate selection** neither emits `compositionend` nor receives a timely
//! `input`; the input is delayed and ordered before its keydown. xterm therefore sends the character only after
//! the **next input**, appearing as a long punctuation lag. Chinese text entered through pinyin and candidate
//! selection is unaffected, and Chromium handles identical frontend code correctly by processing directly
//! committed punctuation synchronously as keydown. The fault is therefore in WebKit, not xterm, this project,
//! or the user's IME.
//!
//! ## Only directly committed full-width punctuation uses the input-event workaround
//! Safari/WebKit traces captured in June 2026 confirm that lag occurs only for directly committed punctuation.
//! An isolated punctuation character emits only `input` (`inputType=insertText`, `isComposing=false`) and no
//! compositionend, with input/keydown reversed and xterm's state machine disrupted. `onInput` handles that path.
//! Candidate-based commits emit compositionend normally and do not lag, so compositionend remains entirely under
//! xterm's native composition handling. An earlier compositionend workaround was removed because it addressed no
//! real lag and incorrectly intercepted composed non-Han input such as Japanese kana and Korean Hangul.
//!
//! ## Approach, using only public APIs
//! Write the reliable, immediate text from `input` directly to the PTY, bypassing WebKit's late reordered event.
//! xterm later emits the same text through `onData`; a short-lived deduplication table consumes that duplicate.
//! Because xterm emits exactly the committed event `data`, exact string matching does not affect other input.
//!
//! ## Half-width pass-through symbols use keyup
//! WKWebView tests show that in Chinese and similar modes, half-width symbols passed through without conversion or
//! candidate selection receive `input` only on the **next keypress**. The final symbol can remain stuck indefinitely,
//! and continuous typing stays one character behind. The timely `keyup` contains the committed character in `key`,
//! so send it immediately and let the deduplication table consume xterm's later copy.
//!
//! Four checks constrain the workaround:
//! - **keyCode===229** identifies an IME-processed keydown across languages. English input uses the real code and
//!   is never recorded.
//! - The keyup `key` must be a half-width ASCII symbol. Full-width conversions normally fall outside ASCII and
//!   use the input path; letters, numbers, and spaces are excluded by `isPassthroughSymbol`. Some Shift-modified
//!   keys can still report their half-width source, so the next two checks are also required.
//! - A timely input clears the keydown marker before keyup, preventing a duplicate. Only pass-through symbols with
//!   delayed input retain the marker and are sent from keyup.
//! - A late reordered keydown is not marked. For full-width punctuation, input arrives first; marking the later
//!   keydown would cause keyup to send the half-width source as well. Any IME keydown arriving within
//!   `REORDERED_KEYDOWN_MS` of an immediate input commit is treated as that reordered event and ignored.
//!
//! ## Deliberately narrow scope
//! - Enable only on WebKit (WKWebView, WebKitGTK, Safari), never Chromium/WebView2 where event ordering is correct.
//! - `onInput` accepts only non-composing `insertText` data made entirely of full-width/CJK punctuation. Normal
//!   ASCII, composing Chinese, Japanese kana, and Korean Hangul remain untouched.
//!
//! The workaround is isolated and removable by deleting this file and its three connections in usePtySession.ts.
